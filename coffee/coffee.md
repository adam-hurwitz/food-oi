## Flavor wheel

#### Steps

1. Look at the flavor wheel: [Interactive Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel](https://notbadcoffee.com/flavor-wheel-en/) *by notbadcoffee.com*
2. Start at the center with the more broad flavors and work outwards to the more specific flavors choosing and/or adding flavors along the way
    1. Repeat the process for as many types of flavors that you discover
    2. Better understand the meaning of certain flavors if needed by using the [Sensory Lexicon](https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/resources/sensory-lexicon)

#### Sample flavors

- Fruit
    - Measured by sweetness, acidity, sourness, and color
    - Red fruit
        - High sweetness, low acidity, medium sourness, and dark

## Roast type

#### About

- The roast type is determined by the temperature and length of roasting

#### Medium

- Medium roasts are more flavorful than darker roasts

#### Dark

- Dark roasting burns away many of the healthy antioxidants
- Burnt bean flavor could be a sign of carcinogens due to acrylamide
    - Acrylamide is created naturally when certain foods reach high temperatures through a chemical reaction

#### Light

- Light vs dark roast caffeine level differences are negligible
- Light roasts have a higher level of a carcinogen (Acrylamide) than dark roasts
    - Acrylamide levels are higher early in the heating process and then decline

#### Resources

## Fermentation

#### About

- Fungus, bacteria, and yeast feed off of the coffee bean pulp and natural sugars
- The byproducts are alcohols, acids, and esters

#### Flavors

- Creaminess
- Sweetness, e.g. honey: Fermented with pulp
- Cacao/chocolatiness: Fermented a longer time

## Freshness

- The beans may taste stale after 1-2 weeks from being roasted

## Natural vs synthetic flavor

#### Synthetic chemicals are used in some flavored beans

- Basic aromatics like chocolatey, nutty, spices, juniper fruit, stone fruit, or floral finish are brought out naturally with no chemicals.
- Other flavors like pumpkin spice, vanilla, etc. are likely chemical based.

#### To research

- What sort of chemicals are used and are there potential negative health impacts?
- Do most single-origin beans have their natural flavors without the synthetic chemical process?
- *See [How are Coffee Beans Flavored](https://coffeeinformer.com/flavored-coffee-beans/) by Coffee Informer*

## Coffee species

#### About

- The quality and flavor of coffee beans are determined by the species of coffee tree
- Coffee trees are both naturally and genetically modified
- The speed of the coffee growth impacts flavor
    - The longer the growth time the better the flavor
    - Can be ≥ 1 year to grow high quality coffee
- Surrounding plants may or may not impact the coffee beans flavor
    - This is a theory that there are multiple opinions on
- Tea can be made from the coffee bean extract that results from the peeling process

## Hand vs machine separated beans

#### Hand separated

- Beans that are hand separated have a stronger natural flavor 
- Hand separated beans retain more of the natural fruit flavor vs machine separated beans

## Compounds

- There are >1,000 chemical compounds in coffee
- *See [List of chemical compounds in coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chemical_compounds_in_coffee) by Wikipedia*

## Cupping

#### About

3. Finer grinds
    1. Provide more surface area for the water.
    2. Longer extraction time

#### Hot

1. Brew from 195º - 205ºF
2. Slowly pour over the filter, waiting for water to pass through the filter before pouring more water.

#### Iced

- Quick method
  1. Let the brewed coffee sit for two 2 min.
  2. Pour the brewed coffee into an iced container and refrigerate.

#### V60 vs Chemex

- A V60 produces better flavor: The groves in the V60 allow the oxygen and steam to vent out the side groves leaving more flavor in the beans
